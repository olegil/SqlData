#SQL Data

SQL Data is an ORM for C# to SQL without any of the bloat. If you have used ORMs in the past like Entity Framework or NHibernate, you may have noticed that they are ridiculously huge. The reason is that they have much more, sometimes unnecessary, functionality included. If you are using one of these ORMs and are utilizing all of this functionality, then SQL Data is not a good fit. Sql Data is designed to be extremely light weight. The number one goal of this ORM is to allow the developer to obtain data from a SQL database and use this data in strongly typed classes, and do it fast! To put it simply, SQL Data allows you to get data from a SQL database easily, quickly and efficiently.

Here are some of the features included in SQL Data:

Manages SQL connections in an intuitive manner
Execute statements directly against the database without returning results
Query and return a collection CLR classes
Query and return dynamic results
Query and return a scalar result
Handle CRUD operations through intuitive extension methods on your classes
You can do bulk inserts of any IList<> with one line of code!
and much more...

Here are some of the things that SQL Data does NOT do:

Generate classes based on database schema
Handle concurrency
Slow you down!
